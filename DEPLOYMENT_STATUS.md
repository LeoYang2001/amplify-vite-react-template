# Google OAuth Deployment Summary

## Current Status: ❌ Production Deployment Failed

The deployment failed due to Amplify Gen2 secret management limitations in production environments.

## Working Solutions:

### ✅ Local Development (Sandbox)
- Google OAuth working perfectly in sandbox mode
- Secrets managed via `npx ampx sandbox secret set`
- All callback URLs and configurations working

### ❌ Production Deployment
- Amplify Gen2 requires different secret management for production
- Environment variables in Console not working with `secret()` function
- AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store approach also failing

## Immediate Solutions:

### Option 1: Temporary Direct Configuration (Quick Test)
Remove the `secret()` functions temporarily and use direct values:

```typescript
// TEMPORARY - for testing only
export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
    externalProviders: {
      google: {
        clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID || "your-client-id",
        clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET || "your-secret",
        scopes: ["email", "openid", "profile"],
      },
      // ... rest of config
    },
  },
});
```

### Option 2: Wait for Amplify Gen2 Updates
Amplify Gen2 is relatively new and secret management for production is still evolving.

### Option 3: Revert to Amplify CLI v1
Use the traditional Amplify CLI which has more mature secret management.

## Production URLs (when working):
- **App URL**: `https://d1h1j924lgaa6v.amplifyapp.com`
- **App ID**: `d1h1j924lgaa6v`

## Google Cloud Console Configuration:
Once deployed, add these redirect URIs:
- `https://d1h1j924lgaa6v.amplifyapp.com`
- Cognito domain URLs (from amplify_outputs.json)

## Next Steps:
1. Choose temporary solution for immediate testing
2. Monitor Amplify Gen2 documentation for proper production secret management
3. Test OAuth flow once deployed
4. Implement proper security before production use
